An open source Flutter app for viewing data from a Concept2 indoor rowing machine. Inspired by the original ErgData app.

This is a project that is created as a more advanced demo application for showing off the behavior of the `c2bluetooth` library. This is a library that aims to make it easy for developers to build flutter apps that integrate with the data from Concept2 PM5 rowing machines. 

## Building
Build process is just like any flutter app



Tested primarily on Android with some Linux desktop testing used for layout prototyping. Results on other platforms may vary, linux desktop seems to be lacking support from the underlying bluetooth library.
